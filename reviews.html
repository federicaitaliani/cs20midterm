"I’ve never had a travel experience quite like the one I had with Escape Route. 
From the moment I reached out, they understood exactly what I was looking for—complete 
relaxation in a remote, beautiful location. They found me the perfect eco-lodge in Costa 
Rica where I could disconnect and recharge. Every detail, from transportation to 
activities, was taken care of flawlessly. I’m already planning my next adventure with 
them!"

2. David L. – London, UK
"Escape Route turned our honeymoon into a dream come true. We wanted something off 
the beaten path, but with all the luxury we could imagine. They arranged a private 
villa on a secluded beach in Bali, complete with personalized tours and candlelit 
dinners. The team went above and beyond to make sure everything was perfect. Highly 
recommend them for any special occasion!"

3. Maria G. – San Francisco, CA
"As a family of five, it can be challenging to find a trip that works for everyone, 
but Escape Route made it happen! They planned an incredible adventure through Italy, 
combining kid-friendly activities with some much-needed relaxation for my husband and me. 
The itinerary was spot on, and we didn’t have to worry about a thing. I can’t wait to use 
their services for our next family trip!"

4. Jonathan H. – Vancouver, Canada
"I’ve always loved traveling, but planning everything myself used to be so 
stressful—until I found Escape Route. They’ve organized two trips for me now, 
and both were absolutely amazing. My latest trip was a wellness retreat in Thailand, 
complete with yoga, meditation, and spa treatments in a stunning setting. Escape Route 
really understands how to make a trip feel like a personal escape. Five stars all 
the way!"

5. Emily P. – Sydney, Australia
"Escape Route’s cultural immersion program was exactly what I was looking for. 
I wanted to explore Japan beyond the typical tourist spots, and they arranged the 
most incredible experiences—from learning traditional tea ceremonies with a local 
family to visiting hidden temples. The attention to detail was impeccable, and I 
felt like I truly connected with the culture. I’ll definitely be back for more 
adventures with them!"

6. Mike T. – Austin, TX
"I recently used Escape Route for a corporate retreat, and I can’t speak highly 
enough of their services. They arranged everything from the venue to team-building 
activities in a beautiful mountain resort. My team had an incredible time bonding 
while hiking and participating in creative workshops. It was a perfect blend of 
productivity and relaxation, all thanks to Escape Route’s meticulous planning."

7. Olivia R. – Paris, France
"My experience with Escape Route was beyond my expectations. I wanted to celebrate 
my 30th birthday with friends in style, and they helped me organize an unforgettable 
trip to the Amalfi Coast. From a private yacht to gourmet dining experiences, everything 
was luxurious yet personal. The best part? I didn’t have to worry about a single detail. 
I’ll never travel without them again!"

8. Jack K. – Miami, FL
"If you want adventure, Escape Route is the way to go! I’m an avid hiker, and they 
planned a week-long trek through Patagonia for me that was the perfect balance of 
challenge and beauty. The local guides they connected me with were incredibly 
knowledgeable, and the accommodations were surprisingly comfortable for such a remote 
location. I’ll definitely be booking my next adventure with them soon!"

"Escape Route took care of every detail of our luxury Mediterranean cruise. From the 
moment we set sail, everything was organized perfectly, from private excursions to 
gourmet meals. It was the most stress-free, pampered vacation I’ve ever had, and I 
can’t thank the team enough for making it such a memorable experience. I highly 
recommend their services!"

10. Carlos A. – Barcelona, Spain
"As someone who loves food and wine, I was blown away by the culinary tour Escape 
Route created for me in France. I got to meet local chefs, visit beautiful vineyards, 
and experience Michelin-starred restaurants. The personalized attention to my tastes 
made all the difference. I’ve traveled with many agencies before, but none have come 
close to the exceptional service and creativity of Escape Route!"
